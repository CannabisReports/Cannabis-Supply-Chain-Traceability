# Cannabis Supply Chain Traceability

_Disclaimer: This document, and all contents of this repository are currently in the process of being released. All content, files, and licenses are subject to change._

## Problem this Solves

The cannabis industry is moving forward at a global scale faster than technology and policy makers can keep up. There is not a standard for the way we identify and describe cannabis products. This is detrimental to research, technology, and the ability for all to participate equally and safely in a global cannabis marketplace.

## How this Project Solves this Problem

This is meant to be a living, open document that provides guidelines which may be adopted by any organization or technology to increase traceability and transparency throughout the global cannabis supply chain.
